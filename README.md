#Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Analysis and Classification
This project focuses on the analysis and classification of cervical cancer risk factors. It involves various machine learning techniques using a dataset and ultimately builds a model to predict the presence of cervical cancer based on demographic and medical features.

#Dataset
The dataset contains cervical cancer risk factors and includes various demographic and medical characteristics. The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled. Then, data analysis and visualization steps are performed.

#Machine Learning
Machine learning steps include splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, scaling features, model selection, and tuning hyperparameters. The project utilizes different classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines and etc.

#Performance Evaluation
In the final section, the performance of the created model is evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation, GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning are employed to improve the model.

#Requirements
The following Python libraries are needed to run the project:

pandas
matplotlib
numpy
seaborn
scikit-learn

#Contributions
Contributions of any kind are welcome. If you find a bug or have an improvement suggestion, feel free to submit a pull request!
